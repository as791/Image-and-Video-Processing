# Image-and-Video-Processing
This repo includes the tutorial codes written in MATLAB for Image & Video Processing Course. Each tutorial consists of different tasks which are implemented from scratch and the each result is compared with required inbuilt image processing functions of the MATLAB. 
### Tutorial - 1
1) Given RGB Image separate intensity & color information using different color model & display them separately & then combine them back into  original RGB and compare with original.
2) Given a gray scale image find the image negative.
3) Given a gray scale image find & display magnitude of fourier specturm and apply log transformation and Power law transformation on it.
4) Given  a gray scale image do a histogram equalization enhancement on it
### Tutorial - 2 
1) Implementation of Marr-Hildreth Edge detector and Canny Edge detector on given input image.
2) Peform phase only reconstruction using two images.
3) Compute 2D fourier spectrum of an image and center the magnitude spectrum and apply log transformation.
