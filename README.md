# Image-and-Video-Processing
This repo includes the tutorial codes written in MATLAB for Image & Video Processing Course. Each tutorial consists of different tasks which are implemented from scratch and the each result is compared with required inbuilt image processing functions of the MATLAB. 
### Tutorial - 1
1) Given RGB Image separate intensity & color information using different color model & display them separately & then combine them back into  original RGB and compare with original.
2) Given a gray scale image find the image negative.
3) Given a gray scale image find & display magnitude of fourier specturm and apply log transformation and Power law transformation on it.
4) Given  a gray scale image do a histogram equalization enhancement on it
### Tutorial - 2 
1) Implementation of Marr-Hildreth Edge detector and Canny Edge detector on given input image.
2) Peform phase only reconstruction using two images.
3) Compute 2D fourier spectrum of an image and center the magnitude spectrum and apply log transformation.
### Tutorial-3
1) Perform Laplace based sharpening in the frequency domain.
2) Perform Gaussian and Butterworth based Lowpass and Highpass filtering in a fingerprint image in frequency domain.
3) Take a noisy fingerprint image, then preprocess the image using different morphological operators.
### Tutorial-4
1) Take a fingerprint image, add salt and pepper noise. Perform the median filtering and contraharmonic mean filtering. Show the effect of the wrong choice of polarity in the order Q.
### Tutorial-5
1) Assume degradation model derived for motion blurring, apply it to any good quality image to create the distorted image. Then apply full inverse filtering, radially limited inverse filtering and Wiener filtering to restore the original image.
2) While capturing any face image, ask the person to move, the resultant image will be distorted, then try the above degaration model to restore the face image.
